1. In most cases, the threshold is an intensity value, above which pixels are treated as white,
and below which pixels are treated as white.  Specific descriptions are below:

Threshold Truncaded:
Shifts the entire image towards a lower (darker) intensity level. 

Binary Threshold:
Send every pixel in the image to black or white, depending on whether it is above or below
some specified threshold

Band Theshold:
Sends every pixel with an intensity value outside of a given range to black, and sends
pixels inside that band to white.  

Semi Thresholding:
Sends pixels that are relatively close to black or white to 0 or 255, and medium intensity
pixels are scaled towards 0 and 255 to make up the vacated space in the intensity spectrum


2. Binary Thresholding destroys all shades of gray.  Everything is sent to black or white and
any smaller variations are lost.  


3. Adaptive Thresholding uses the local area around a picture to determine an best threshold to use with this pixel.  This is useful when there is shading variation across a surface.
